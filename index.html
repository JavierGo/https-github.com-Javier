 <p> Project Overview
You will design, create, and update a website hosted by GitHub Pages. The realization of this website will consist of both reinforcing ideas you’ve worked with in previous semesters and pushing yourself to add unique new features you have not yet mastered. When you begin your independent project, this website will be the place where you document your progress and process. For your transition to college and a career, you will need a professional online presence - you can achieve this with a portfolio website.
    </p>
    <p>Your name should be visible and there should be a working hyperlink to your CS Pathway Reading Journal at the top of the page.

Create a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file and link it to your index.html file. This CSS should contain all code used to style your site. In the stylesheet, please create a custom class that adds efficiency and style to your Portfolio site.
    </p>
    <p>Elements of a clear design aesthetic and attention to detail should be evident. Consider drawing inspiration from sites such as MaterialUp, Dribbble, or Awwwards. Include descriptive names when creating CSS classes (consider using Material Design language like .accentColor or .primaryColor). Please include an HTML comment with the URL of a site that inspired your design.
    </p>
    <p> Plan and code a unique feature into your website. Think about something interesting you’d like to see on your homepage and make it happen. Consider using source code (by “Inspecting” elements on a page) and drawing inspiration/technical support from sites such as Codepen.io, Awwwards, or our old friends Google + Stack Overflow.
